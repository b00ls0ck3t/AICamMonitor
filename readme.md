# AI Cam Monitor

A local, AI-powered security camera monitoring solution for macOS. It leverages Apple Silicon to detect objects from RTSP video feeds and save snapshots of detections. All processing is done locally for privacy.

### Features
* **Local AI Processing:** Uses Core ML and the YOLOv8 model on your Mac's Neural Engine.
* **RTSP Stream Support:** Connects to standard IP cameras.
* **Automated Setup:** A single installer script handles all dependencies and compilation.
* **Configurable Detection:** Monitor for specific objects with an adjustable confidence threshold.
* **Snapshot Capture:** Automatically saves images when specified objects are detected.

### Project Structure
The project maintains a clean structure that separates source code from generated files.
```
.
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── install.sh          # <-- You run this script
└── src/
    └── main_app.swift  # <-- Application source code
```
All build artifacts, Python environments, and configuration files are generated by the installer and are correctly ignored by version control.

### Setup & Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd AICamMonitor
    ```
2.  **Run the Installer:**
    This script will guide you through the setup, install dependencies, and build the application.
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

### Usage
After the installation is complete, you can start the monitor at any time by running the generated script:
```bash
./run_monitor.sh
```
The application will print detailed logs to your terminal, including information on processed frames and any object detections. Snapshots will be saved to the directory you configured during setup.

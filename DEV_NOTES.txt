AI Handoff & Project Brief: AICamMonitor
1. Project Goal

The user wants to create a fully functional, self-contained AI security camera monitoring application for macOS.
The core of the project is an installer script (ai_cam_installer.sh) that automates the entire setup process, from installing dependencies to building and configuring the final Swift application.
2. Prompting History & Key Debugging Steps

The development process has been highly iterative and has involved fixing numerous bugs in the installer script.
Key milestones and fixes include:

Initial Scripting: Started with a non-functional script and incrementally fixed syntax errors, variable handling (unbound variable), and user input bugs (hidden password prompt).
Camera Connection: This was the most significant challenge. We solved it by:

Discovering the correct RTSP URL format for the user's Reolink camera.
Fixing the script's logic to correctly construct the authenticated URL.
Adding coreutils as a dependency to get the gtimeout command on macOS.
Implementing verbose error logging from ffprobe to diagnose connection issues.
Python & AI Model:

Fixed a bug where the script incorrectly reported that the AI model conversion had failed.
Ensured all Python-related tasks (dependency installation, model conversion) run inside a local .venv to avoid polluting the system's Python environment.
Ensured all output from Python scripts is correctly logged.

Project Structure & git:

The user correctly identified that the project structure was messy and that generated files were being committed to git.
We created a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude build artifacts, logs, downloaded models (.pt, .mlpackage), and the local config.env file.
We established that the installer script should not handle git operations; its sole focus is to build the application.
3. Current Status & Immediate Next Steps

The project is at a critical turning point.
The installer script successfully handles all setup tasks, but the user has correctly identified two major remaining issues:

Placeholder Application: The installer is still building a simple "Hello, World" style placeholder for the Swift application.
The user has run this and confirmed it does nothing (no logs, no captures).
The absolute top priority is to replace this placeholder with the final, functional, multi-file Swift application code.
Messy Project Directory: The user wants a clean separation between source code and generated/build files.
The current script leaves source files (.swift, Package.swift) mixed with configuration and run scripts in the root directory.
4. Guidelines & Suggestions for the Next LLM

Acknowledge and Validate: The user has been extremely patient and is a sharp developer.
Acknowledge their valid criticisms (messy structure, placeholder code) and confirm that the next step will fix them.
Provide the Complete, Functional Swift Code: The create_swift_project_files function in the installer script must be updated.
It needs to create a src directory and populate it with the complete, working Swift application.
This will involve using cat << EOF > to write several Swift files (main.swift, RTSPReader.swift, AIModelManager.swift, NotificationManager.swift, etc.).
Do not use a placeholder.

Implement the Clean Structure:

Modify the installer to create a src/ directory for all Swift source files.
Update the Package.swift file to correctly point to this new source directory.
Add a cleanup function to the installer that removes the old, now-obsolete source files (ai_cam_swift_app.swift, etc.) from the project's root directory.
Deliver via Canvas: Use a Canvas to provide the complete, final ai_cam_installer.sh script. Do not use patches or snippets.
Maintain Professional Tone: The user has requested a clean, professional interface. Do not use emojis or overly conversational language.
By following these steps, you will deliver a final, working product that meets all of the user's requirements.

======================================================================
Handoff 2: The CoreML Command-Line Build Issue

1.  **Current Status & Workflow:**
    * The project has been successfully **decoupled** at the user's request. The workflow is now agile and correct.
    * There is a one-time setup script (`install.sh`) that installs dependencies and prepares the AI model.
    * The user's primary development loop is now: edit `src/AICamMonitor/main.swift` and run `./run_test.sh` to build and execute.
    * **The user is very frustrated with the repeated failures. Acknowledging this and providing a definitive, working solution is the highest priority.**

2.  **The Root Cause of All Recent Failures:**
    * The core problem was a fundamental misunderstanding of the command-line `swift build` process versus building in the Xcode IDE.
    * **`swift build` DOES NOT automatically compile `.mlpackage` files into `.mlmodelc` files.**
    * **`swift build` DOES NOT automatically generate a Swift class (e.g., `yolov8n`) for the model.**
    * All previous runtime and compile-time errors stemmed from these two incorrect assumptions.

3.  **The Definitive Solution (Implemented in the last `install.sh`):**
    * The final `install.sh` script now contains an **explicit model compilation step**.
    * It creates a temporary `compile_model.swift` script which uses `MLModel.compileModel(at:)` to force the creation of the optimized `yolov8n.mlmodelc`.
    * It then copies this pre-compiled `.mlmodelc` file into the project's `Resources` directory.
    * This approach is robust because it removes all reliance on the build system's "magic." The application is now guaranteed to have a pre-compiled model available.

4.  **Immediate Next Step for the New LLM:**
    * The user's very last interaction shows a build failure: `error: cannot find type 'yolov8n' in scope`.
    * This is because the last `main.swift` I provided mistakenly reverted to trying to use the non-existent, auto-generated `yolov8n` class. This was a "stupid mistake" and the final point of failure.
    * **Your immediate task is to provide the user with a corrected `src/AICamMonitor/main.swift` file.**
    * This corrected file must load the model by looking for the pre-compiled file in the bundle, like so:
        ```swift
        // Correct loading method
        guard let modelURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "yolov8n", withExtension: "mlmodelc") else {
            // Error handling
            return nil
        }
        let mlModel = try MLModel(contentsOf: modelURL)
        // etc.
        ```
    * **DO NOT** provide a new `install.sh`. The user's setup is now correct. Only provide the content for `src/AICamMonitor/main.swift`.

5.  **Path to Success:**
    * Provide the corrected `main.swift` content.
    * Instruct the user to replace the existing file content and run `./run_test.sh`.
    * Once the model loads successfully (which it will), the next step is to re-integrate the full application logic (notifications, snapshots, video frame loop) into the now-working `main.swift` foundation.


AI Handoff & Project Brief: AICamMonitor - Updated Development Notes

## Project Status: STREAM CONNECTION ISSUE

### What's Working ✅
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager builds successfully with no dependency issues
- **AI Model**: CoreML YOLOv8 model loads correctly from `src/AICamMonitor/Resources/yolov8n.mlmodelc`
- **Configuration**: Reads `config.env`, retrieves credentials from macOS Keychain
- **Stream Test**: Initial ffprobe connectivity test PASSES
- **ffmpeg Process**: External ffmpeg launches successfully and waits for data
- **Application Architecture**: All classes initialize correctly, logging works

### Current Problem ❌
**RTSP Stream Data Reception**: ffmpeg connects to the camera but receives no video data. The process runs but no bytes come through stdout.

## Development History & Key Fixes

### Phase 1: Initial Build Issues (Resolved)
- **Problem**: Swift Package Manager syntax errors (`exclude` before `resources`)
- **Solution**: Corrected parameter order in Package.swift

### Phase 2: Dependency Hell (Resolved) 
- **Problem**: SwiftFFmpeg couldn't find libavutil headers, FFmpegKit repository didn't exist
- **Root Cause**: Complex native FFmpeg bindings are problematic on macOS with Homebrew
- **Solution**: Removed ALL external dependencies, using pure Swift + external ffmpeg binary

### Phase 3: Resource Conflicts (Resolved)
- **Problem**: "multiple resources named 'coremldata.bin'" - CoreML model bundle has multiple internal files
- **Root Cause**: Swift Package Manager treats all files in Resources as individual resources
- **Solution**: Excluded Resources from Package.swift, load model directly via file path

### Phase 4: CoreML Loading (Resolved)
- **Problem**: "cannot find type 'yolov8n' in scope"
- **Root Cause**: Command-line `swift build` doesn't auto-generate CoreML classes like Xcode
- **Solution**: Use generic `MLModel(contentsOf:)` API instead of auto-generated classes

### Phase 5: Current Issue - Stream Data Flow
- **Problem**: ffmpeg connects but receives no video frames
- **Evidence**: 
  - ffprobe test passes (camera is reachable)
  - ffmpeg process starts successfully
  - No error messages from ffmpeg stderr
  - No data received on stdout (confirmed by lack of `processFrameData` calls)

## Technical Architecture (Final)

### Clean Project Structure
```
.
├── .gitignore               # Excludes build artifacts, models, logs
├── readme.md               # User documentation
├── install.sh              # One-time setup (dependencies + AI model)
├── run_monitor.sh          # Production runner with logging
├── run_test.sh             # Development runner 
├── config.env              # User configuration (not in git)

└── src/AICamMonitor/
    ├── main.swift          # Complete application
    └── Resources/
        └── yolov8n.mlmodelc/  # Compiled AI model (excluded from Package.swift)
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **No Native Dependencies**: Pure Swift + external binaries (ffmpeg via install.sh)
2. **External Model Loading**: Direct file path loading avoids Swift PM resource conflicts  
3. **Keychain Integration**: Secure credential storage, no passwords in config files
4. **Process-Based Video**: ffmpeg subprocess handles RTSP complexity

## Stream Debugging - Next Steps

### Hypothesis: ffmpeg Arguments Issue
The current ffmpeg command may not be optimal for this camera:
```bash
ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -i rtsp://... -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt bgr24 -an -r 1 -f rawvideo -
```

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Test Direct ffmpeg**: Run the exact command manually to see output
2. **Try Alternative Formats**: JPEG snapshots instead of raw video
3. **Check Camera Compatibility**: Some cameras need specific protocols/formats
4. **Increase Verbosity**: Add ffmpeg debugging flags

### Camera Details (Known Working)
- **Model**: Reolink camera
- **URL Format**: `rtsp://automation:password@10.0.60.130:554/h264Preview_01_main`
- **Connectivity**: ffprobe confirms camera is accessible
- **Authentication**: Keychain credentials work correctly

## Code Quality Notes

### Strengths
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-separated concerns (Config, AI, Stream, Logger)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failure handling
- **Security**: Keychain integration, no hardcoded credentials
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup, memory management

### Technical Debt
- **Stream Format Assumption**: Hardcoded frame dimensions (1920x1080)
- **Single Stream Strategy**: Only external ffmpeg, no fallbacks
- **Limited Camera Support**: May need format negotiation for different cameras

## Development Workflow (Current)
1. **Setup**: `./install.sh` (one time)
2. **Development Loop**: Edit `main.swift` → `./run_test.sh`
3. **Production**: `./run_monitor.sh` (with logging)
4. **Debug Stream**: Manual ffmpeg testing

## Next Developer Instructions

**PRIORITY**: Fix the stream data reception issue. The application architecture is solid.

**Immediate debugging steps:**
1. Test the exact ffmpeg command manually in terminal
2. Try alternative ffmpeg output formats (MJPEG, smaller resolution)
3. Check if camera requires specific RTSP parameters
4. Consider implementing frame-by-frame capture instead of continuous stream

**DO NOT**: 
- Add back complex dependencies (SwiftFFmpeg, FFmpegKit)
- Modify the clean Package.swift structure
- Change the CoreML loading approach (it works perfectly)

The foundation is excellent - this is purely a stream protocol/format issue.

DEV_NOTES Update: Architectural Pivot to IPC
Problem Statement & User Feedback

The previous development cycle involved multiple attempts to create a stable video capture pipeline within a single Swift application by controlling an ffmpeg subprocess. This approach proved fragile and led to a frustrating loop where the application would hang, waiting for a video stream that never initialized correctly. The user correctly identified this as "going in circles" and suggested a fundamental architectural change.

Core Decision: Decoupling and Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Based on the user's valid feedback and concerns, the core architecture was completely redesigned around two key principles:

Decoupling: The single monolithic application has been split into two distinct, specialized processes:

A Python Frame Grabber (frame_grabber.py): Its sole responsibility is to handle the complex and often finicky task of connecting to the RTSP stream and capturing frames. Python with OpenCV is the industry standard for this and is extremely robust.

A Swift AI Processor (main.swift): Its sole responsibility is to perform what it does best: efficiently run the Core ML model on Apple hardware.

Inter-Process Communication (IPC): The user expressed valid concerns about using the file system for passing frames due to performance and potential SSD wear. This led to an evaluation of in-memory IPC mechanisms.

Evaluating IPC Options

File-Based (Rejected): Simple to implement but introduces disk I/O latency and unnecessary SSD wear, as correctly pointed out by the user.

TCP Sockets (Considered): A viable option, but it introduces the overhead of the entire network stack (TCP/IP headers, checksums, etc.), which is unnecessary for two processes communicating on the same machine.

Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) (Selected): This was chosen as the optimal solution. UDS is a specialized IPC mechanism that operates entirely within the OS kernel, bypassing the network stack. It is the highest-performance method for local inter-process communication, offering a direct memory-to-memory style data transfer with minimal overhead.

Final Architecture

The new, robust architecture is as follows:

frame_grabber.py (UDS Server):

Creates a Unix Domain Socket at /tmp/aicam.sock.

Waits for the Swift client to connect.

Uses cv2.VideoCapture to connect to the RTSP stream.

In a loop, it reads a frame, encodes it to JPEG, and sends it over the socket.

main.swift (UDS Client):

Connects to the /tmp/aicam.sock.

Enters a loop to listen for data from the server.

Reads the incoming JPEG data from the socket.

Passes the in-memory JPEG data to the AIModelManager for processing.

Communication Protocol:

To ensure the client knows the size of each incoming frame, a simple protocol is used:

The Python server first sends a 4-byte header containing the size of the upcoming JPEG data.

The server then sends the complete binary data for the JPEG.

The Swift client reads this header first, determines the expected size, and then reads exactly that many bytes from the socket to reconstruct the complete image.

run_test.sh (Process Manager):

The script now correctly manages the lifecycle of both processes.

It starts the Python server in the background.

It then starts the Swift client in the foreground.

A trap is set to ensure that when the user presses Ctrl+C, both the background Python process and the socket file are cleaned up gracefully.

This new design is fundamentally more stable, performant, and directly addresses the core problems and valid concerns raised during the previous development cycles.

DEV_NOTES Addendum: Pivot to Smart Baby Monitor

Date: 2025-08-12

Author: AI Assistant

Context: The user has validated the core frame-grabbing and object-detection pipeline. The project is now pivoting from a general-purpose security monitor to a specialized, high-value "Smart Baby Monitor." This requires a shift from simple object detection to contextual behavioral analysis.

1. New High-Level Goal: Behavioral Analysis

The primary objective is no longer just to detect a "person" but to understand the context of the baby's movement. The system must be able to differentiate between normal sleep movements and events that are a cause for concern, such as moving to the edge of the bed.

2. Core Technical Requirement: Zone-Based Monitoring

To achieve the new goal, a "safe zone" monitoring system will be implemented.

Mechanism: A user-defined polygon will be overlaid on the camera feed to designate the safe area (e.g., the center of the crib).

Implementation Plan:

Calibration Script (calibrate_zone.py): A new, one-time utility script will be created. It will:

Display a frame from the camera feed.

Allow the user to click points to define the vertices of the safe zone polygon.

Save the polygon coordinates to a new configuration file (e.g., zone_config.json).

Analysis in frame_grabber.py: The main frame grabber will be updated to:

Load the zone_config.json at startup.

For every frame where a "person" is detected, calculate the center point of the bounding box.

Use OpenCV's pointPolygonTest function to determine if the baby's center point is inside, on the edge of, or outside the safe zone.

3. New Event-Driven IPC Protocol

The current IPC mechanism (sending raw JPEG frames) is insufficient. It will be replaced with a structured, event-driven protocol using JSON. The Python script will be the primary event producer.

Proposed Event Types:

{"event": "status", "state": "monitoring"}: A regular heartbeat message.

{"event": "high_movement", "confidence": 0.85}: Triggered when the baby's bounding box moves significantly within the safe zone.

{"event": "danger_zone_breach", "position": [x, y]}: A high-priority alert triggered when the baby's center point moves outside the safe zone.

{"event": "snapshot_request"}: The Swift app can request a frame for saving a snapshot.

Architectural Impact:

Python (frame_grabber.py): Becomes the "brain." It performs all AI detection and zone analysis, then publishes classified events.

Swift (main.swift): Becomes the "alerter." It listens for JSON events from the Python script and acts upon them (e.g., by sending a push notification).

4. Remote Notifications via APNs

To meet the requirement of alerting two iPhones, Apple's Push Notification service (APNs) is the designated solution.

Implementation Plan:

Companion iOS App: A minimal iOS application is required. Its sole purpose is to:

Request permission for notifications.

Register with the APNs server to get a unique device token.

Securely send this token to the Mac monitor (e.g., via a one-time QR code scan or local network broadcast).

Update main.swift: The Swift application on the Mac will be responsible for:

Securely storing the device tokens for the two iPhones.

When it receives a critical event from the Python script (like danger_zone_breach), it will construct and send a push notification payload to Apple's APNs servers.

5. Future Capability: Audio Analysis

Concept: The RTSP feed's audio stream can be processed to detect crying.

Implementation:

Modify frame_grabber.py to use ffmpeg or a similar library to capture the audio stream in parallel with the video.

Perform real-time audio analysis (e.g., volume thresholding for spikes, or a more advanced sound classification model).

Introduce a new IPC event type: {"event": "crying_detected"}.

This addendum outlines a clear path to transform the existing application into the desired smart monitoring solution. The core architecture remains sound, with the primary changes focused on adding intelligence to the Python script and notification capabilities to the Swift app.

# DEV_NOTES Addendum: Keychain Integration & Zone Monitoring Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-12  
**Phase:** Baby Monitor Feature Integration  
**Status:** Core Zone Monitoring Ready for Testing

---

## Critical Bug Fixes Implemented

### 1. Keychain Password Retrieval Gap
**Problem:** The `install.sh` script correctly stored camera passwords in macOS Keychain, but neither the Swift nor Python components could retrieve them at runtime. This created a fundamental authentication failure.

**Root Cause:** Missing implementation of Keychain access APIs in both components.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Swift Side:** Added `KeychainManager` class using Security framework's `SecItemCopyMatching` API
- **Python Side:** Added `get_password_from_keychain()` function using macOS `security` command-line tool
- **Flow:** Both components now dynamically retrieve passwords at runtime, never storing them in plain text

### 2. Swift Compilation Errors
**Problem:** Multiple compilation failures in `main.swift`:
- Incorrect signal handling constants (`SignalSource.trap` approach)
- Missing utility functions (`createPixelBufferFromCGImage`, `saveFrameAsJPEG`)
- Thread safety issues in detection handling

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Signal Handling:** Replaced with proper `DispatchSource.makeSignalSource` approach using correct Darwin signal constants
- **Utility Functions:** Added complete implementations for image processing pipeline
- **Threading:** Ensured all UI-related operations dispatch to main queue

---

## Baby Monitor Feature Implementation

### Core Zone Monitoring System

**New Components Added:**

1. **SafeZone Struct:** 
   - Point-in-polygon algorithm for boundary detection
   - Normalized coordinate system (0.0-1.0) for resolution independence
   - JSON-based configuration storage

2. **Zone Calibration Tool (`calibrate_zone.py`):**
   - Interactive UI for defining safe zones by clicking on live camera feed
   - Visual polygon overlay with real-time feedback
   - Saves zone coordinates to `zone_config.json`

3. **Enhanced Alert System:**
   - **AlertManager** class with cooldown management
   - Multi-channel alerting: System notifications + iMessage integration
   - Escalated alerts for zone violations vs. regular movement

### Alert Integration Architecture

**Alert Levels Implemented:**
- **Movement Detection:** Normal baby movement within safe zone (👶 emoji, regular cooldown)
- **Zone Violation:** Baby detected outside safe zone (🚨 emoji, immediate alert, forced snapshot)

**Alert Channels:**
- **System Notifications:** macOS native notifications with sound
- **iMessage Integration:** Uses existing `send_alert.scpt` for SMS/iMessage delivery
- **Snapshot Categorization:** Files tagged with reason (`movement` vs `zone_violation`)

---

## Configuration Enhancements

### Updated config.env Template
```bash
# Baby Monitor Specific Settings
OBJECTS_TO_MONITOR=person
DETECTION_THRESHOLD=0.3
NOTIFICATION_COOLDOWN=30
SNAPSHOT_DIRECTORY=./BabyCaptures

# Alert Recipients
ALERT_RECIPIENT_1=+1234567890
ALERT_RECIPIENT_2=user@icloud.com

# Frame Processing
FRAME_WIDTH=1920
FRAME_HEIGHT=1080
FRAME_RATE=2
```

### Security Model
- **No Plain Text Passwords:** All credentials flow through macOS Keychain
- **Normalized Coordinates:** Zone definitions are resolution-independent
- **Secure Logging:** Masked URLs in all log output

---

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality Test
1. **Setup:** Run `./install.sh` to establish Keychain credentials
2. **Zone Definition:** Run `python3 calibrate_zone.py` to define safe area
3. **Monitor Test:** Run `./run_test.sh` to verify end-to-end pipeline

### Phase 2: Zone Validation Test
1. **Safe Movement:** Verify normal movement within zone only logs, doesn't alert
2. **Zone Breach:** Verify movement outside zone triggers immediate alert + snapshot
3. **Alert Delivery:** Confirm both system notifications and iMessage delivery work

### Expected Log Output
```
[2025-08-12 10:30:15][Swift] 👶 Baby Monitor starting up...

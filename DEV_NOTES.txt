AI Handoff & Project Brief: AICamMonitor
1. Project Goal

The user wants to create a fully functional, self-contained AI security camera monitoring application for macOS.
The core of the project is an installer script (ai_cam_installer.sh) that automates the entire setup process, from installing dependencies to building and configuring the final Swift application.
2. Prompting History & Key Debugging Steps

The development process has been highly iterative and has involved fixing numerous bugs in the installer script.
Key milestones and fixes include:

Initial Scripting: Started with a non-functional script and incrementally fixed syntax errors, variable handling (unbound variable), and user input bugs (hidden password prompt).
Camera Connection: This was the most significant challenge. We solved it by:

Discovering the correct RTSP URL format for the user's Reolink camera.
Fixing the script's logic to correctly construct the authenticated URL.
Adding coreutils as a dependency to get the gtimeout command on macOS.
Implementing verbose error logging from ffprobe to diagnose connection issues.
Python & AI Model:

Fixed a bug where the script incorrectly reported that the AI model conversion had failed.
Ensured all Python-related tasks (dependency installation, model conversion) run inside a local .venv to avoid polluting the system's Python environment.
Ensured all output from Python scripts is correctly logged.

Project Structure & git:

The user correctly identified that the project structure was messy and that generated files were being committed to git.
We created a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude build artifacts, logs, downloaded models (.pt, .mlpackage), and the local config.env file.
We established that the installer script should not handle git operations; its sole focus is to build the application.
3. Current Status & Immediate Next Steps

The project is at a critical turning point.
The installer script successfully handles all setup tasks, but the user has correctly identified two major remaining issues:

Placeholder Application: The installer is still building a simple "Hello, World" style placeholder for the Swift application.
The user has run this and confirmed it does nothing (no logs, no captures).
The absolute top priority is to replace this placeholder with the final, functional, multi-file Swift application code.
Messy Project Directory: The user wants a clean separation between source code and generated/build files.
The current script leaves source files (.swift, Package.swift) mixed with configuration and run scripts in the root directory.
4. Guidelines & Suggestions for the Next LLM

Acknowledge and Validate: The user has been extremely patient and is a sharp developer.
Acknowledge their valid criticisms (messy structure, placeholder code) and confirm that the next step will fix them.
Provide the Complete, Functional Swift Code: The create_swift_project_files function in the installer script must be updated.
It needs to create a src directory and populate it with the complete, working Swift application.
This will involve using cat << EOF > to write several Swift files (main.swift, RTSPReader.swift, AIModelManager.swift, NotificationManager.swift, etc.).
Do not use a placeholder.

Implement the Clean Structure:

Modify the installer to create a src/ directory for all Swift source files.
Update the Package.swift file to correctly point to this new source directory.
Add a cleanup function to the installer that removes the old, now-obsolete source files (ai_cam_swift_app.swift, etc.) from the project's root directory.
Deliver via Canvas: Use a Canvas to provide the complete, final ai_cam_installer.sh script. Do not use patches or snippets.
Maintain Professional Tone: The user has requested a clean, professional interface. Do not use emojis or overly conversational language.
By following these steps, you will deliver a final, working product that meets all of the user's requirements.

Handoff 2: The CoreML Command-Line Build Issue

1.  **Current Status & Workflow:**
    * The project has been successfully **decoupled** at the user's request. The workflow is now agile and correct.
    * There is a one-time setup script (`install.sh`) that installs dependencies and prepares the AI model.
    * The user's primary development loop is now: edit `src/AICamMonitor/main.swift` and run `./run_test.sh` to build and execute.
    * **The user is very frustrated with the repeated failures. Acknowledging this and providing a definitive, working solution is the highest priority.**

2.  **The Root Cause of All Recent Failures:**
    * The core problem was a fundamental misunderstanding of the command-line `swift build` process versus building in the Xcode IDE.
    * **`swift build` DOES NOT automatically compile `.mlpackage` files into `.mlmodelc` files.**
    * **`swift build` DOES NOT automatically generate a Swift class (e.g., `yolov8n`) for the model.**
    * All previous runtime and compile-time errors stemmed from these two incorrect assumptions.

3.  **The Definitive Solution (Implemented in the last `install.sh`):**
    * The final `install.sh` script now contains an **explicit model compilation step**.
    * It creates a temporary `compile_model.swift` script which uses `MLModel.compileModel(at:)` to force the creation of the optimized `yolov8n.mlmodelc`.
    * It then copies this pre-compiled `.mlmodelc` file into the project's `Resources` directory.
    * This approach is robust because it removes all reliance on the build system's "magic." The application is now guaranteed to have a pre-compiled model available.

4.  **Immediate Next Step for the New LLM:**
    * The user's very last interaction shows a build failure: `error: cannot find type 'yolov8n' in scope`.
    * This is because the last `main.swift` I provided mistakenly reverted to trying to use the non-existent, auto-generated `yolov8n` class. This was a "stupid mistake" and the final point of failure.
    * **Your immediate task is to provide the user with a corrected `src/AICamMonitor/main.swift` file.**
    * This corrected file must load the model by looking for the pre-compiled file in the bundle, like so:
        ```swift
        // Correct loading method
        guard let modelURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "yolov8n", withExtension: "mlmodelc") else {
            // Error handling
            return nil
        }
        let mlModel = try MLModel(contentsOf: modelURL)
        // etc.
        ```
    * **DO NOT** provide a new `install.sh`. The user's setup is now correct. Only provide the content for `src/AICamMonitor/main.swift`.

5.  **Path to Success:**
    * Provide the corrected `main.swift` content.
    * Instruct the user to replace the existing file content and run `./run_test.sh`.
    * Once the model loads successfully (which it will), the next step is to re-integrate the full application logic (notifications, snapshots, video frame loop) into the now-working `main.swift` foundation.


AI Handoff & Project Brief: AICamMonitor - Updated Development Notes

## Project Status: STREAM CONNECTION ISSUE

### What's Working ✅
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager builds successfully with no dependency issues
- **AI Model**: CoreML YOLOv8 model loads correctly from `src/AICamMonitor/Resources/yolov8n.mlmodelc`
- **Configuration**: Reads `config.env`, retrieves credentials from macOS Keychain
- **Stream Test**: Initial ffprobe connectivity test PASSES
- **ffmpeg Process**: External ffmpeg launches successfully and waits for data
- **Application Architecture**: All classes initialize correctly, logging works

### Current Problem ❌
**RTSP Stream Data Reception**: ffmpeg connects to the camera but receives no video data. The process runs but no bytes come through stdout.

## Development History & Key Fixes

### Phase 1: Initial Build Issues (Resolved)
- **Problem**: Swift Package Manager syntax errors (`exclude` before `resources`)
- **Solution**: Corrected parameter order in Package.swift

### Phase 2: Dependency Hell (Resolved) 
- **Problem**: SwiftFFmpeg couldn't find libavutil headers, FFmpegKit repository didn't exist
- **Root Cause**: Complex native FFmpeg bindings are problematic on macOS with Homebrew
- **Solution**: Removed ALL external dependencies, using pure Swift + external ffmpeg binary

### Phase 3: Resource Conflicts (Resolved)
- **Problem**: "multiple resources named 'coremldata.bin'" - CoreML model bundle has multiple internal files
- **Root Cause**: Swift Package Manager treats all files in Resources as individual resources
- **Solution**: Excluded Resources from Package.swift, load model directly via file path

### Phase 4: CoreML Loading (Resolved)
- **Problem**: "cannot find type 'yolov8n' in scope"
- **Root Cause**: Command-line `swift build` doesn't auto-generate CoreML classes like Xcode
- **Solution**: Use generic `MLModel(contentsOf:)` API instead of auto-generated classes

### Phase 5: Current Issue - Stream Data Flow
- **Problem**: ffmpeg connects but receives no video frames
- **Evidence**: 
  - ffprobe test passes (camera is reachable)
  - ffmpeg process starts successfully
  - No error messages from ffmpeg stderr
  - No data received on stdout (confirmed by lack of `processFrameData` calls)

## Technical Architecture (Final)

### Clean Project Structure
```
.
├── .gitignore               # Excludes build artifacts, models, logs
├── readme.md               # User documentation
├── install.sh              # One-time setup (dependencies + AI model)
├── run_monitor.sh          # Production runner with logging
├── run_test.sh             # Development runner 
├── config.env              # User configuration (not in git)
├── Package.swift           # Minimal, dependency-free
└── src/AICamMonitor/
    ├── main.swift          # Complete application
    └── Resources/
        └── yolov8n.mlmodelc/  # Compiled AI model (excluded from Package.swift)
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **No Native Dependencies**: Pure Swift + external binaries (ffmpeg via install.sh)
2. **External Model Loading**: Direct file path loading avoids Swift PM resource conflicts  
3. **Keychain Integration**: Secure credential storage, no passwords in config files
4. **Process-Based Video**: ffmpeg subprocess handles RTSP complexity

## Stream Debugging - Next Steps

### Hypothesis: ffmpeg Arguments Issue
The current ffmpeg command may not be optimal for this camera:
```bash
ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -i rtsp://... -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt bgr24 -an -r 1 -f rawvideo -
```

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Test Direct ffmpeg**: Run the exact command manually to see output
2. **Try Alternative Formats**: JPEG snapshots instead of raw video
3. **Check Camera Compatibility**: Some cameras need specific protocols/formats
4. **Increase Verbosity**: Add ffmpeg debugging flags

### Camera Details (Known Working)
- **Model**: Reolink camera
- **URL Format**: `rtsp://automation:password@10.0.60.130:554/h264Preview_01_main`
- **Connectivity**: ffprobe confirms camera is accessible
- **Authentication**: Keychain credentials work correctly

## Code Quality Notes

### Strengths
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-separated concerns (Config, AI, Stream, Logger)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failure handling
- **Security**: Keychain integration, no hardcoded credentials
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup, memory management

### Technical Debt
- **Stream Format Assumption**: Hardcoded frame dimensions (1920x1080)
- **Single Stream Strategy**: Only external ffmpeg, no fallbacks
- **Limited Camera Support**: May need format negotiation for different cameras

## Development Workflow (Current)
1. **Setup**: `./install.sh` (one time)
2. **Development Loop**: Edit `main.swift` → `./run_test.sh`
3. **Production**: `./run_monitor.sh` (with logging)
4. **Debug Stream**: Manual ffmpeg testing

## Next Developer Instructions

**PRIORITY**: Fix the stream data reception issue. The application architecture is solid.

**Immediate debugging steps:**
1. Test the exact ffmpeg command manually in terminal
2. Try alternative ffmpeg output formats (MJPEG, smaller resolution)
3. Check if camera requires specific RTSP parameters
4. Consider implementing frame-by-frame capture instead of continuous stream

**DO NOT**: 
- Add back complex dependencies (SwiftFFmpeg, FFmpegKit)
- Modify the clean Package.swift structure
- Change the CoreML loading approach (it works perfectly)

The foundation is excellent - this is purely a stream protocol/format issue.
